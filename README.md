- PostgreSQL

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
reddit-data-pipeline/
├── producer/
│   ├── producer.py             # Reddit data collection using PRAW
├── consumer/
│   ├── spark_consumer.py       # Spark streaming application
├── logs/
│   ├── logger.py               # Logging configuration
├── docker-compose.yml          # Docker Compose configuration
└── README.md
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reddit-data-pipeline.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd reddit-data-pipeline
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with necessary environment variables.

## Configuration

- Configure your Reddit API credentials in `.env`.
- Update Kafka and Spark configurations in `docker-compose.yml`.
- Update PostgreSQL connection properties in `spark_consumer.py`.

## Usage

1. Start the Kafka, Spark, and PostgreSQL containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Run the Kafka producer to collect Reddit data:

   ```bash
   python producer/producer.py
   ```

3. Run the Spark consumer to process data and push to PostgreSQL:

   ```bash
   docker-compose run --rm spark-submit
   ```
